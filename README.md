# script-8

## TODO
- start writing the game. additional features will be revealed

- save to gist (MOST IMPORTANT)

- add fps counter to iframe (perhaps a stats mode?)
- make an icon for System
  - feels weird to click that and be taken to a barless place. maybe it shouldn't feel like another menu item.
- add intro/bios/boot screen
