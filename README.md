# script-8

## TODO
- start writing the game. additional features will be revealed

- save to gist (MOST IMPORTANT)
  - first version
    - learn how to distinguish between prod and dev (env variable?)
    - add failure action handlers
    - show that the gist was saved, and show a way to get to the link

  - second version
    - if it's mine, save a new revision
    - if it's not mine, fork and save
    - if it doesn't exist, create and save

  - third version
    - drop gatekeeper, it's too slow


- load from gist in url
  - parse the query string, and fetch the gist
  - somehow display that we're showing a remote gist

- read up on how long we should keep around a user token
- add fps counter to iframe (perhaps a stats mode?)
- make an icon for System
  - feels weird to click that and be taken to a barless place. maybe it shouldn't feel like another menu item.
- add intro/bios/boot screen
