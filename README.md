# script-8

## TODO
- start writing the game. additional features will be revealed

- save to gist (MOST IMPORTANT)
  - if it's mine, save a new revision
  - if it's not mine, fork and save
  - if it doesn't exist, create and save

- load from gist in url
  - parse the query string, and fetch the gist

- drop gatekeeper, it's too slow

- add fps counter to iframe (perhaps a stats mode?)

- make an icon for System
  - feels weird to click that and be taken to a barless place.
  - maybe it shouldn't feel like another menu item.

- add intro/bios/boot screen
