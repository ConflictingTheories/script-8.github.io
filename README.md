# script-8

## TODO
- start writing the game. additional features will be revealed

- save to gist (MOST IMPORTANT)
  - learn how to distinguish between prod and dev (env variable?)
  - if the token is set (and maybe if we can check it works?) then don't get an oauth token first
  - find out how long a token lasts, so we don't ask for it unless necessary
  - if it's mine, save a new revision
  - if it's not mine, fork and save
  - if it doesn't exist, create and save
  

- add fps counter to iframe (perhaps a stats mode?)
- make an icon for System
  - feels weird to click that and be taken to a barless place. maybe it shouldn't feel like another menu item.
- add intro/bios/boot screen
- read up on how long we should keep around a user token
