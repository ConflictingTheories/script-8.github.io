# script-8

## TODO
- save to gist (MOST IMPORTANT)
  - if it's mine, save a new revision
  - if it's not mine, fork and save
  - if it doesn't exist, create and save

- add a readme to the gist, and point back here
- drop gatekeeper, it's too slow
- add fps counter to iframe (perhaps a stats mode?)
- things are getting too verbose! there are too many props being passed around
