# script-8

## TODO
- modify canvas api:
  - don't allow rects like 1xN or Nx1
  - add a line call

- add sound
  - initial sfx state should be {},
    - and we should handle the null bars in notespad
  - sfx should have its own save

- add way to specify frame rate
- when fetching gist, try to do hit github directly by using user's token
- add fps counter to iframe (perhaps a stats mode?)
- drop gatekeeper, it's too slow
