As the background shows, the SCRIPT-8 display is 128 by 128 pixels.
Play around with the code. See if you can change the color of the ball.
You could also try drawing multiple balls.

script8.update = function() {

}

script8.draw = function() {

  // draw background
  rectFill(0, 0, 128, 128, 6)

  // draw paddle
  rectFill(52, 122, 24, 4, 3)

  // draw ball
  circFill(64, 64, 4, 1)

}
